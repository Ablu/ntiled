#NTiled

A library for working with Tiled 0.91 maps (tmx).

##What works?

At the moment, NTiled can read tile layers, properties and tileset data from maps.   
Object layers will soon be implemented. Error checking is also (at the moment) non-existing.

The API will encounter some breaking changes.   
Missing features can be found in the road map below.
